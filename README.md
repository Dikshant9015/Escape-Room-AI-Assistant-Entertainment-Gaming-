Escape Room AI

Overview

Escape Room AI is an interactive puzzle game built using Python and Pygame. The player must navigate through a procedurally generated maze, collect a key, and escape through the exit. The game uses A search algorithm* for optimal pathfinding and includes sound effects, animations, and a visually appealing UI to enhance user experience.

Features

Procedurally Generated Maze: Each playthrough features a unique maze generated using recursive backtracking.

AI Pathfinding: Utilizes the A algorithm* to guide the player toward the exit once the key is collected.

Dynamic Gameplay: Real-time interaction with obstacles, key collection, and exit unlocking.

Sound Effects & Background Music: Enhances immersion with background music and action-triggered sound effects.

Graphical Interface: High-quality sprites for player, walls, floor, keys, and exit.

End Screen Animation: Displays a message upon successful escape.
